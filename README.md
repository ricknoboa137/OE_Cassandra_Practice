# OE_Cassandra_Practice

## Prepare the dockerized Environment

Give execution permission to the bash files
```bash
chmod +x single-start.sh
chmod +x single-cli.sh
```

Create a docker env and run Cassandra
```bash
./single-start.sh
```

Start a single client
``` bash
./single-cli.sh
```

Start CQL Shell from the container
``` bash
cqlsh
```

### Inside Cassandra

create Keyspace for a slingle client
``` sql
CREATE KEYSPACE lab WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
```
access the "lab" environment

```sql
USE lab;
```

## Task N_1

We are required to create the table acording each query 

For this exercise we are going to use the data set ```bash posts.csv ```

* The following query is needed:

```sql
SELECT entry_title, content 
FROM posts 
WHERE userid = 'john doe' AND blog_title='John''s Blog' 
             AND posted_at >= '2012-01-01' AND posted_at < '2012-01-31';

```
* What should be the PRIMARY KEY?

* Based on the previously created table. Is the following query allowed?

```sql
SELECT entry_title, content
 FROM posts 
WHERE userid = 'john doe' 
             AND posted_at >= '2012-01-01' AND posted_at < '2012-01-31';
```

* Based on the previously created table. Is the following query allowed?

```sql
SELECT * FROM posts 
WHERE userid = 'john doe' 
         AND (blog_title, posted_at) > ('John''s Blog', '2012-01-01');

```


We are creating the datastore for the European Traffic Incidents Office. All incidents arrive with the following information

#### Create tables according each query requirements

### Fields
* Registration country code
* Registration number
* Driver PID
* Driver name
* Incident's date and time
* Incidentâ€™s location
* Penalty points (if any)

### Queries

### By Vehicle

Provide a list of incidents of a vehicle for a specific date range, sorted by incident's date and time (newest first).

##

*Hint: 

```sql
COPY incidents_by_vehicle (reg_nr, reg_country, driver_pid, driver_name, incident_time, incident_location, penality_points) 
FROM 'incidents.csv';
```

* Filter by: Vehicle & incident timestamp
* Sort by: incident timestamp


### By Driver

Provide the same list for a driver (identified by Driver PID), sorted by vehicle, then by date and time (newest first).

*Hint: 

```sql
COPY incidents_by_driver (reg_nr, reg_country, driver_pid, driver_name, incident_time, incident_location, penality_points) 
FROM 'incidents.csv';
```

* Filter by: driver pid
* Sort by: vehicle, incident timestamp (DESC)
